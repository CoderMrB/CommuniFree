## Introduction ü•ï	


Welcome to our GitHub page! We are the Boat Rockers': a dynamic group of six full stack developers from the prestigious School of Code. We embarked on an exciting five-week group project that resulted in the creation of our innovative and cutting-edge app, Communifree.

At Boat Rockers, we aim to address pressing societal issues. Our app tackles two significant problems: the wastage of excess food and the financial struggles faced by many during the cost of living crisis. 

By fostering community engagement, promoting environmental responsibility, facilitating COVID recovery, and championing kindness and mental well-being, we strive to make a lasting difference.

Together we can make a meaningful impact in our society.
