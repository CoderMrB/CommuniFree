# üëã Welcome to CommuniFree- the food sharing app! ü•ï

We are the Boat Rockers: a dynamic group of six full-stack developers from the prestigious School of Code. We embarked on an exciting five-week group project that resulted in the creation of our innovative and cutting-edge app, Communifree.

At Boat Rockers, we aim to address pressing societal issues. Our app tackles two significant problems: the wastage of excess food and the financial struggles faced by many during the cost of living crisis. 

We aim to foster community engagement, promote environmental responsibility, and champion kindness and mental well-being. In short, we strive to make a lasting difference. 

Together we can make a meaningful impact in our society.

## **Project description**

### The Problem
Through extensive brainstorming and discussion as a group, we identified food waste and the cost of living crisis as two real-world problems that we would like to address with our app.

We conducted user research to investigate the problem of food waste, and found that two-thirds of respondents reported throwing away good quality food at least once a week because they'd bought too much. Three-quarters of respondents indicated that they would be interested in an app that would allow them to give away such unwanted food items, and 40% reported that they were very concerned about the level of food waste across the country. In fact, all of our respondents indicated some degree of concern over this issue.

We felt that during a cost of living crisis, facilitating the sharing of free food within the community would also help to reduce the financial burden being felt by so many.

Furthermore, as many communities are still feeling the impact of social isolation imposed during the pandemic, we hoped another benefit of a food sharing app would be to reconnect people with those living in their local area.
